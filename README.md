## HK4E Sophon Downloader

A tool to download anime game assets using their new Sophon-based download system.

Starting from version `5.6`, they transitioned to using **Sophon Chunks** for updates and discontinued distributing ZIP files.
As a result, it is no longer possible to download game assets **without using their Launcher**.
This tool aims to bypass that limitation, so you can download directly, efficiently, and without bloat.


## Features

- Full and Update download modes
- Uses official API (`getBuild`, `getUrl`, etc.)
- Language/region selector
- Built-in auto validation via real-time API
- Fast, parallel downloads (multi-threaded)
- Zero dependencies


## Requirements

- Install [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)

> ðŸ’€ .NET 9.0 SDK already exists. Only **retards** are still stuck with .NET 8.0,  
> and only **goblins** are still using .NET 7.0 or below. Evolve.

## config.json

This file is auto-generated if not found.  
You can customize the default region, versions, and more.

Example:

```json
{
  "Region": "OSREL",
  "Branch": "main",
  "LauncherId": "VYTpXlbWo8",
  "PlatApp": "ddxf6vlr1reo",
  "Threads": 8,
  "MaxHttpHandle": 128,
  "Silent": false,
  "Versions": {
    "full": ["5.6", "5.7"],
    "update": [
      ["5.5", "5.6"],
	  ["5.5", "5.7"],
      ["5.6", "5.7"]
    ]
  }
}
```


## Notes

- If you mess up the config, the app will silently fallback to default values â€” no mercy.
- Garbage values like `"Silent": lmao` or `"Threads": 99999` **Silently fixed automatically.**
- Version/tag values are validated **live via the API**, not by regex.
  If your version doesn't exist, you'll get a clean `[ERROR] Failed to fetch manifest` â€” no crash.
- Maximum thread count = your CPU core count (capped automatically).
- This tool is intended for **educational and preservation purposes only.**
